Here are the instructions and explanations for my open-ended final:

This program is a guess-the-ghost game based on the game Phasmophobia. There are three games (derived from a base game class) where the program picks a ghost and you have to guess it. (To make this easy to test for people who don't know Phasmophobia, the program tells you the right answer at the start, but feel free to type phantom, demon, and shade each time to see how the hints work) 

The main menu has 5 options, and I'll explain each. To choose an option, type the number listed and press enter.
1. Classic - When you guess a ghost, it tells you how the answer compares with your guess. For example, if you guess a slow ghost and the answer was a fast ghost, it would say "faster" in the speed category.
At the start you can change settings to make it more difficult. By default it chooses the easiest settings, but you can turn off each individual hint.
2. Sleuth - Rather than getting hints from your guesses, it gives you a profile at the start and no more hints. The guessing and settings are the same.
3. Trait - Similar to Sleuth, it starts with your hints, which are a more in-depth description of the ghost. After a couple guesses it gives a hint. There aren't settings for this one.
4. List - This just shows you all information. You can use it at the start to have ideas for other ghosts to guess.
